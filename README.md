## 🗺️ Learning Roadmap

The complete structured roadmap is available here:

👉 [Python Complete Core Mastery Roadmap]([https://whimsical.com/python-complete-core-mastery-Km2CEGjjqL9ktV4pBPYSTj](https://whimsical.com/python-complete-core-mastery-Km2CEGjjqL9ktV4pBPYSTj))

This repository implements that roadmap in structured lessons.

## 🚀 About This Repository

**LearnPython** is a deep, structured knowledge base designed to build real engineering mastery.

This is not a collection of beginner tutorials.

It is a long-term, production-focused learning system covering:

- Core Python internals
- Concurrency & async architecture
- FastAPI & ASGI systems
- Performance engineering
- Backend design principles

The goal is simple:

> Move from writing Python code → to designing scalable backend systems.

# 🧠 CorePython (Python Mastery)

This section builds deep language understanding.

Topics include:

- Execution model
- Memory model
- Object model
- Data model & dunder methods
- Decorators & closures
- Descriptors
- Metaclasses
- Generators & iterators
- Garbage collection
- CPython internals
- Bytecode inspection

Goal:

> Understand Python the way CPython understands it.

---

# ⚡ Concurrency & Async

Deep dive into:

- GIL realities
- Threading vs Multiprocessing
- AsyncIO internals
- Event loop lifecycle
- Awaitable protocol
- Context switching cost
- CPU-bound vs IO-bound tradeoffs
- Structured concurrency

Goal:

> Know exactly when async helps — and when it doesn’t.

---

# 🏗️ FastAPI Engineering

This section focuses on real backend systems.

Covers:

- ASGI internals
- Request lifecycle
- Dependency injection
- Middleware architecture
- Background tasks
- Security (OAuth2, JWT)
- Caching strategies
- Production deployment patterns
- Throughput & latency tuning

Goal:

> Build scalable, maintainable backend services.

---

# 🔥 Performance & Optimization

Includes:

- Profiling techniques
- Memory analysis
- Time complexity in real systems
- Benchmarking
- FastAPI performance tuning
- Architectural optimization vs micro-optimization

---

# 🧩 Learning Approach

Each lesson is structured to include:

- Conceptual foundation
- Internal mechanics
- Advanced patterns
- Production pitfalls
- Performance implications
- Backend relevance

This repository emphasizes:

- Mental models over memorization
- Internals over surface syntax
- Architecture over shortcuts

---

# 🎯 Intended Audience

This repository is for:

- Backend engineers
- FastAPI developers
- System architects
- Engineers preparing for senior roles
- Developers building scalable systems

Not intended for:

- Absolute beginners with zero Python exposure

---

# 🏁 Long-Term Vision

This repository will evolve into:

- A structured documentation site
- A backend engineering reference
- A system design knowledge base
- A complete Python mastery roadmap

---

## 💡 Final Objective

Master Python.
Master backend architecture.
Build systems — not scripts.
